# SimpleCalculator

This was a small project I used to help me switch over to Python and learn the basics of the language. It is a program that logs in/signs up users using an authentication process that stores users in a text file. Once authenticated the user will be able to use the operation provided by the program. SimpleCalculator can only perform a handful on operations which include: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and getting the quotient and  exponent.
